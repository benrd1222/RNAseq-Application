What tool am I considering designing for RNAseq pipelines?


There are plenty of tutorials on how to set the data up post quality control.


What is generally more annoying is DESeq2's need to define the contrasts and managing the different contrasts when looking at the data as a whole.



Personally for me what would be useful for future bulk sequencing analyses is to have a script that:

In:
- The post-QC data
- The Metadata
- Reference level (otherwise reference level will be implied by DESeq2)
- The formula for the GLM
- Padj method, default to BH

- Cutoffs for padj and significant LFC
    - allow for vectorization of this input
-Number of top genes

-reference library for species: drop down, if other allow string input to grab from bioconductor
- BF, CC, or MF defaults to all three being produced

Out: This output really will require a flowchart for felxibility depending on the formula input
- A DESeq2 datastructure
- Flexible PCA

- Volcano Plot
- Summaries of the top changed genes for chosen contrasts (geneID (given a species from drop down), LFC)

-GSEA's of each treatment: either all BF, CC, MF.




Could make this a Shiny App:
- instead of a bunch of outputs being saved, make it a dynamic graphical output where they can change cutoffs and contrasts
- And drop downs where they can choose what to export (which contrasts with which cutoffs)

- The dynamic nature of an App would let me set up a venn diagram section where they could drop down which treatments they want to compare

-Gene Ontology would also be a good dynamic visual
    - Choose your treatment
    - Choose your ontology database
    - Number of groups
    - GSEA for general
    - ORA: triggers filtering of up or down regulated genes in selected treatment
   * For this function it would be important to store GSEAs and ORAs already run in a tmp folder to reference if they want to see it again and
visualize a different number of groups* Then write the data to their project folder when they click export

# Start the design from the simplestformula possible

Control vs Treatment:
Y~X- this can be scaled by the levels of X

Full Factorial:
Y~X1+X2+X1*X2 - this harder to
